= CSC258 Computer =

== Introduction ==

The CSC258 computer is a hypothetical machine created by Eric Hehner at the
University of Toronto. Officially, its behavior and assembly language syntax are
specified.

This package contains a rich set of software tools and sample programs for the
CSC258 computer. It was developed from scratch by Nayuki Minase in 2010, and is
licensed under the MIT License (see below) (open source). The tools are written
in Java (version 1.5 or above).


== Features ==

User features:
 * Command-line runner (csc258comp.runner.Csc258Runner)
 * Graphical debugger (Swing UI) (csc258comp.debugger.Csc258Debugger)
   * State of registers
   * Execution step, run
   * Breakpoints
   * Source code
 * Meaningful error messages from the compiler
 * Sample programs (in the "demos" directory)

Developer features:
 * Clean code, easily modifiable and extensible
 * Code guards against null pointers, out-of-bounds, illegal input parameters,
   and other misuses of the API in a fail-fast way
 * Some functionality is covered by JUnit tests
 * Compilation is separated from linking


== Building ==

Run javac on every .java file. Or better yet, import the project into an IDE
like Eclipse or NetBeans.


== Running ==

You must set the working directory or the class path to the appropriate root for
Java class files. For example, if the runner is located at /the/package/
csc258comp/runner/Csc258Runner.class, then you must do one of these:
 * cd /the/package
   java csc258comp.runner.Csc258Runner [CSC258 files]
 * java -cp /the/package csc258comp.runner.Csc258Runner [CSC258 files]
 * export CLASSPATH=/the/package
   java csc258comp.runner.Csc258Runner [CSC258 files]

Examples:
 * java csc258comp.runner.Csc258Runner demos/helloworld.258.txt
 * java csc258comp.runner.Csc258Runner demos/primes.258.txt
       demos/lib/const.258.txt demos/lib/printInt.258.txt
